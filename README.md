# Flask Web App featuring Neural Style Transfer and Visualization


This project features neural style transfer made from scratch using VGG19 which we display in a flask web-application. I was responsible for implementing neural style transfer while my teammate @cerredz implemented the react.js frontend. This project won best overall hack at TCNJ's 2023 hackathon.

On my own outside of the hackathon, I added my own way to visualize the algorithm so you can see the progression of the content image over time. An example is shown below as well as some cool results from the Neural Style Transfer algorithm
