# Flask Web App featuring Neural Style Transfer


This project features neural style transfer made from scratch using VGG19. We display it in a flask web-application. I was responsible for implementing neural style transfer while my teammate @cerredz implemented the react.js frontend. This project won best overall hack at TCNJ's 2023 hackathon.
