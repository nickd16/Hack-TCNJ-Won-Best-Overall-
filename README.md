# Flask Web App featuring Neural Style Transfer


This project features neural style transfer made from scratch using VGG19. We display it in a flask web-application and this project won me and @cerredz best overall hack at TCNJ's 2023 hackathon. I was responsibile for implementing neural style transfer, cerredz created our frontend.
